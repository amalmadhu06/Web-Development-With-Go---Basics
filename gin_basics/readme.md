# Gin
`Gin` is a web framework for the `Go` programming language. It is designed to be a minimal, high-performance framework for building web applications.

This is a simple example of using Gin to create a "Hello, World" web application.

In this example, we import the Gin package and use it to create a router. We then add a route to the router that listens for GET requests to the root path (`/`) and responds with a "Hello, World" message. Finally, we start the server to listen for incoming requests.
